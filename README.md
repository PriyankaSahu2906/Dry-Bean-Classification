# Dry-Bean-Classification
The Dry Bean Classifier project involves building a machine learning model to classify seven types of dry beans using a dataset of 13,611 grains. It leverages features like area, perimeter, axis lengths, and shape factors. Algorithms used include SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, with PCA for feature selection and GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning.
